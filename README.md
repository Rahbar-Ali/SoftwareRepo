# SoftwareRepo
To run the program follow these step:
1. Make sure you have required dependencies installed. such as python 3.x
2. Clone the repository to your local machine by running 'git clone <repository>' I USED MY PERSONAL GIT REPOSITORY HOME-REPAIR-SYSTEM as My System is not powerfull enought to handle BIG repositories
3. Run program  by excuting the following command in the terminal python software_repository.py
4. the program will process the repository and generate a JSON file containing the result in same directory
5. generated JSON file can be opened using a text editor to view results of the program
